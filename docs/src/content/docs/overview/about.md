**Integrify** is an infrastructure tool that enables the creation of integration processes between e-commerce systems, such as stores, and ERP systems. It provides infrastructure based on several areas of integration:

* Customers,
* Orders,
* Products,
* Stocks.

In the integration process, external plugins are used as adapters for external e-commerce systems. The plugins provide data to the integration area, and after the integration process is complete, they transmit the data to another area.
