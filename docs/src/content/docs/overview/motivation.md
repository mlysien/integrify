title: Motivation
---

The motivation to create this tool was born a few years ago when I was working as a .NET developer in the integration area team. I noticed a problem in creating custom integrations between e-commerce systems, which was the lack of a single infrastructure layer between the store and the ERP system. Each integration with an external e-commerce system required a significant amount of work to rebuild the application.

The creation of the Integrify tool is intended to help solve the above problem to some extent. The application has been designed to separate the integration processes of areas from the implementation of integration with external e-commerce systems.
